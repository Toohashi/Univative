# Univative

This Repo is for the competition of Univative 2017.

The repo contains a demo which is bulit based on HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. It tries to help users whose smartphones have limited storage to get access to a specific purpose service -- Tippedn at any time (with internet connections).

This demo is an Alpha-version Web App for the competition, no real function will be added into the repo.
